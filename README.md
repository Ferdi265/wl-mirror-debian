# wl-mirror-debian

This repo contains the debian source package for
[wl-mirror](https://github.com/Ferdi265/wl-mirror).

This is still very WIP and will probably take a while to be done. Currently
only builds without lintian warnings on bookworm since scdoc on buster still
has a bug that breaks the wl-mirror man page.
